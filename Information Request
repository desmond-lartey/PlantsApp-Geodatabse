--1. Budget Analysis:
--a. Which countries have the highest and lowest estimated budgets for adaptation?
-- Highest budget
SELECT Country, Estimated_Budget
FROM budget
ORDER BY Estimated_Budget DESC
LIMIT 15;

-- Lowest budget
SELECT Country, Estimated_Budget

--the countries with the top 5 highest budgets?

SELECT Country, Climate_Vulnerabilities, Estimated_Budget
FROM budget
ORDER BY Estimated_Budget DESC
LIMIT 5;

---2. Adaptation Strategies:
--a. Which plant species are the most commonly recommended across countries?
--(This is a bit complex as the plant species are distributed across multiple columns. 
--However, for simplicity, we can start by checking the first column: OrnamentalPlantSpecies.)

SELECT OrnamentalPlantSpecies, COUNT(*) AS Country_Count
FROM adaptation
GROUP BY OrnamentalPlantSpecies
ORDER BY Country_Count DESC
LIMIT 5;

--a. For the plant species columns, we'll aggregate the counts and list the countries for each species:

    UNION ALL
    SELECT Country, OrnamentalPlantSpecies2 FROM adaptation
    UNION ALL
    SELECT Country, OrnamentalPlantSpecies3 FROM adaptation

WHERE "Climate Trend" iLIKE '%cooling%';

--b. Which countries have the most severe climate states currently?
--(Note: The definition of "rainfall" needs clarity. However, for the sake of demonstration, let's assume we're looking for the word "rainfall" in the "Current Climate State" column.)

GROUP BY Classification, "Suitable Plant Species"
ORDER BY Classification, Country_Count DESC;

--5. Climate Projections:
--a. Which countries are projected to experience the most drastic changes in the next 30 years?
--(Note: The definition of "drastic" needs clarity. For the sake of demonstration, let's look for countries with the word "warming" in the 30-Year Projection column.)

SELECT Country, "30-Year Projection"
FROM climateprojections
WHERE "30-Year Projection" LIKE '%warming%';

--b. Are there any trends in the 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year projections?

-- Trends in 5-year projection
SELECT "5-Year Projection", COUNT(*) AS Country_Count
FROM climateprojections
GROUP BY "5-Year Projection"
ORDER BY Country_Count DESC;

-- Trends in 10-year projection
SELECT "10-Year Projection", COUNT(*) AS Country_Count
FROM climateprojections
GROUP BY "10-Year Projection"
ORDER BY Country_Count DESC;

-- Trends in 30-year projection
SELECT "30-Year Projection", COUNT(*) AS Country_Count
FROM climateprojections
GROUP BY "30-Year Projection"
ORDER BY Country_Count DESC;

--6. Dominant species Analysis:
--What are the dominant species in each country and how many spaces they occupy?
--(Note: This requires a join between the woorld and dominantspecies2 tables. The dominantspecies2 table has a gridcode column and a species column.)

--7. Vulnerabilities:
--a. Which countries are projected to have the most significant vulnerabilities in the future?
